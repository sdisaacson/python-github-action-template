Note that `modifiedSinceDateTime` is optional and is omitted from these examples.\n\n#### Example request with personId\n\n```\n{\n  \"where\": {\n    \"employees\": {\n      \"key\": \"personId\",\n      \"values\": [\n        \"5\",\n        \"6\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Example response with personId\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"personIdentity\": {\n      \"personKey\": 5\n    },\n    \"photo\": {\n      \"image\": \"{base64Image}\",\n      \"imageType\": \"image/png\",\n      \"lastUpdateDateTime\": \"2018-04-22T15:45:26\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"personIdentity\": {\n      \"personKey\": 6\n    },\n    \"photo\": {\n      \"image\": \"{base64Image}\",\n      \"imageType\": \"image/png\",\n      \"lastUpdateDateTime\": \"2019-04-22T15:45:46\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n```\n\n#### Example request with personNumber\n\n```\n{\n  \"where\": {\n    \"employees\": {\n      \"key\": \"personNumber\",\n      \"values\": [\n        \"SEANIVAN\",\n        \"GARRYIVAN\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Example response with personNumber\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"personIdentity\": {\n      \"personNumber\": \"SEANIVAN\",\n      \"personKey\": 5\n    },\n    \"photo\": {\n      \"image\": \"{base64Image}\",\n      \"imageType\": \"image/png\",\n      \"lastUpdateDateTime\": \"2018-04-22T15:45:26\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"personIdentity\": {\n      \"personNumber\": \"GARRYIVAN\",\n      \"personKey\": 6\n    },\n    \"photo\": {\n      \"image\": \"{base64Image}\",\n      \"imageType\": \"image/png\",\n      \"lastUpdateDateTime\": \"2019-04-22T15:45:46\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n```\n\n### Use case: two employees - single key retrieval with modifiedSinceDateTime\n\nThe example request below uses a single key to retrieve employee photo data for two employees. The request includes the optional `modifiedSinceDateTime` property and discusses the particulars of response behavior for each returned employee.\n\n#### Example single key request with modifiedSinceDateTime\n\n```\n{\n  \"where\": {\n    \"employees\": {\n      \"key\": \"personId\",\n      \"values\": [\n        \"5\",\n        \"6\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"multiReadOptions\": {\n    \"modifiedSinceDateTime\": \"2019-01-22T15:45:26.000\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Example single key response with modifiedSinceDateTime\n\nIn the following example, the employee photo for personKey 5 (SEANIVAN) has not been updated since the date and time specified in the `modifiedSinceDateTime` property, so the photo data is not returned in the response. However, note that the `lastUpdateDateTime`of the person's photo record is still included in the response.\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"personIdentity\": {\n      \"personKey\": 5\n    },\n    \"photo\": {\n      \"lastUpdateDateTime\": \"2018-04-22T15:45:26\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"personIdentity\": {\n      \"personKey\": 6\n    },\n    \"photo\": {\n      \"image\": \"{base64Image}\",\n      \"imageType\": \"image/png\",\n      \"lastUpdateDateTime\": \"2019-04-22T15:45:46\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n```\n\n### Use case: two employees - multi-key retrieval with modifiedSinceDateTime\n\nThe example request below uses multiple keys (a pair of AOID and COID keys, which in this example are the same number) to retrieve employee photo data for two employees. The request includes the optional `modifiedSinceDateTime` property and discusses the particulars of response behavior for each returned employee.\n\n#### Example multi-key request with modifiedSinceDateTime\n\n```\n{\n  \"where\": {\n    \"employees\": {\n      \"multi_key\": [\n        \"aoid\",\n        \"coid\"\n      ],\n      \"multi_key_values\": [\n        [\n          \"444556\",\n          \"444556\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"90109\",\n          \"90109\"\n        ]\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"multiReadOptions\": {\n    \"modifiedSinceDateTime\": \"2018-01-22T15:45:26.000\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Example multi-key response with modifiedSinceDateTime\n\nIn the following example, the employee photo for the person defined by `aoid,coid=[\"444556\",\"444556\"]` does not exist, so the photo data and the `lastUpdateDateTime` is not returned in the response. However, note that the `lastUpdateDateTime` of the person's photo record would be included in the response if that person's photo existed but had been last updated prior to the date and time specified in the optional `modifiedSinceDateTime` property.\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"personIdentity\": {\n            \"personNumber\": \"90109\",\n            \"personKey\": 266,\n            \"aoid\": \"90109\",\n            \"coid\": \"90109\"\n        },\n        \"photo\": {\n            \"image\": \"{base64Image}\",\n            \"imageType\": \"image/png\",\n            \"lastUpdateDateTime\": \"2018-04-23T10:16:14\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"personIdentity\": {\n            \"personNumber\": \"444556\",\n            \"personKey\": 1403,\n            \"aoid\": \"444556\",\n            \"coid\": \"444556\"\n        }\n    }\n]\n\n```","operationId":"Retrieve Photos for Multiple Employees","requestBody":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/photoSearchCriteria"}}}},"responses":{"200":{"description":"Successfully retrieved all photo details for a given list of employee references.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/photobean"},"type":"array"}}}},"207":{"description":"Partially succeeded in retrieving photos for a given list of employee references."},"400":{"description":"<p>Bad Request:</p><ul> <li>[WCO-101202] - Could not retrieve the information because of invalid or empty values provided in request. </li> <li>[WCO-101203] - Could not retrieve the information because of invalid or empty key provided in request. </li> <li>[WCO-101207] - Service limit error, number of records exceed the allowed limit : {batchSize} </li> <li>[WCO-101230] - The information in the bean is not valid.
