When enabled, this operation also returns Human Capital Management (HCM) menu links.\n\n## Context Parameters for Menu Links\n\nWhen developing an app that links to various system menu pages, the approach differs depending on whether the user is an employee or manager.\n\n* [Employees](#employees)\n\n* [Managers](#managers)\n\nWhen an employee or a manager is logged in to the UI, the variable `ngStorage-currentContext` stores values that define the user context.\n\n### Employees\n\nTo execute on a link to a menu page with an employee, all context parameters are set to `null` and only the target page is required.\n\nThe value of `ngStorage-currentContext` resembles the following example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"timeframeId\": null,\n  \"hyperfind\": {\n    \"id\": null,\n    \"type\": null\n  },\n   \"peopleIdList\": null,\n  \"dateSpan\": {\n    \"startDate\": null,\n    \"endDate\": null\n  },\n  \"otherContext\"{}\n}\n\n```\n\nFor employees, your app must:\n\n* set the target URL to the menu link\n\n* set the default `null` values for `ngStorage-currentContext`\n\nAfter the values for the `ngStorage-currentContext` variable are set, `pageContextService` functions accordingly.\n\n#### App Sequence for Employee Menu Links\n\n1. Employee successfully logs in to the app\n\n2. Employee selects an option that launches a system menu link\n\n3. The menu link is launched with the appropriate context parameters\n\n4. The system menu link successfully opens in the app\n\n### Managers\n\nThis example concerns a manager who has logged in to the app to view the timecards of direct reports. The manager navigates to the Timecard module in the app, sees a list of all direct reports, and selects a few of them. This is the point where the menu link to the system occurs.\n\nThe value of `ngStorage-currentContext` resembles the following example:\n\n```{\n  \"timeframeId\": 0,\n  \"hyperfind\": {\n    \"id\": null,\n    \"type\": null\n  },\n  \"peopleIdList\": [\n    234,\n    235,\n    236\n  ],\n  \"dateSpan\": {\n    \"startDate\": \"2020-03-05T05:00:00\",\n    \"endDate\": \"2020-03-08T09:00:00\"\n  },\n  \"otherContext\": {},\n  \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-05T05:45:14\"\n}\n\n```\n\nFor managers, your app must:\n\n* set the target URL to the menu link\n\n* set the values for `ngStorage-currentContext` based on the selections the manager made in the app\n\nAfter the values for the `ngStorage-currentContext` variable are set, `pageContextService` functions accordingly.\n\n#### App Sequence for Manager Menu Links\n\n1. Manager successfully logs in to the app\n\n2. Manager views a list of direct reports and selects multiple employees and a date range and executes a task that launches a system menu link\n\n3. The menu link is launched and includes the parameters selected by the manager\n\n4. The menu link successfully opens in the app and displays all of the selected data\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nFor an external app to set context parameters for a system module, that app must set the proper values in `defaultContextService` through `PageContextService`. In the UI, the user's context is always read from `PageContextService` before a module is loaded.\n\nThe code for `defaultContextService.js` is listed below. When a user login in to the UI an object of `defaultContextService` is associated with that login event and is injected into `PageContextService`.\n\nWhen a user navigates from one module to another in the UI, such as from Employee Timecard to Scheduling, the context necessary to transfer the user to the Scheduling module is saved in an object of `defaultContextService` via `PageContextService`.\n\nThis object can save `timeframeId`, `hyperfind`, `peopleIdList`, and `dateSpan` in `PageContextService`.\n\nBefore switching from the current module, all of the user's current selections are set in `PageContextService`. Before launching the new module, the contents of `PageContextService` are read and set in the page to be launched. This allows users to continue to view selections from one module to another.\n\nThe code for `defaultContextService.js` is as follows:\n\n```\ndefine(['angular', 'lodash', '../pageContext'], function (angular, _) {\n  'use strict'\n\n  angular.module('common.pageContext').factory('defaultContext', function () {\n    var defaultContext = {\n      timeframeId: null,\n      hyperfind: {\n        id: null,\n        type: null, //can be 'hyperfind' or 'location'\n      },\n      peopleIdList: null,\n      dateSpan: {\n        startDate: null,\n        endDate: null,\n      },\n      otherContext: {},\n    }\n    return {\n      getDefaultContext: function getDefaultContext() {\n        return _.cloneDeep(defaultContext)\n      },\n    }\n  })\n})\n\n```\n\n### Context Parameter Values\n\n#### timeframeId\n\nThe ID of the timeframe expressed as an integer ID. For example, if the user selected the Current Schedule Period in the UI, that corresponds to an ID value of 4 that is captured in `timeframeId`.\n\n#### peopleIdList\n\nAn array of person keys representing the employees selected by a manager. For example, if a manager selects three employees in an app, the person keys of those three employees is passed in `peopleIdList`.\n\n#### dateSpan\n\nThe `dateSpan` object defines a start date and an end date of a date range selected by a user. For example, suppose a user selected the 5th of March 2020 as the start date and the 8th of March 2020 as the end date. Those dates (and times, if selected) are captured in `dateSpan` under `startDate` and `endDate`.\n\n#### hyperfind\n\nThe `hyperfind` object defines a reference to a Hyperfind using `id` and `type`.\n\nThe `type` parameter defines whether the filtering is based on a location or a Hyperfind query. Valid values include 1 for location and 4 for a Hyperfind query.\n\nThe `id` parameter contains the ID of the selected Hyperfind or location.","operationId":"Retrieve All Menu Items","parameters":[{"description":"The type of Menu Items to retrieve.
